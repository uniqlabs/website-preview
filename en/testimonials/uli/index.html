<p>It is very motivating to work with people who want to move forward in their lives. What I enjoy especially about being
a UNIQ coach is the absolute focus on achieving a chosen goal. Itâ€™s a bit like watching dreams come true. I often
find myself with a big grin on my face at the end of a coaching session.</p>
