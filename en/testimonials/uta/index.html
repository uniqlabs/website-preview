<p>Uniq has picked me up where I have been stuck for a long time: I want to find and realize my calling. In the coaching
session I discovered and started to work on my personal “construction sites”, that have held me back so far. Now
I am on a good path to my goal and the encouragement and tips in the chat are a huge help. This feels great, thank you!</p>
