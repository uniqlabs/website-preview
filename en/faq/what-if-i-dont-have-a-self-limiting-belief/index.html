<p>The 1-on-1 coaching session helps you find a motivating and inspiring belief for your goal. If you have a
self-limiting belief that stands between you and your goal, you will find and resolve it with the help of your coach.
Should you not have a self-limiting belief, thatâ€™s all the better! In that case you can use the session to define the
mindset that you find most inspiring and that will motivate you best to work towards your goal.</p>
