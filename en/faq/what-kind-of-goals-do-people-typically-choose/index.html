<p>There are three big goal areas that many people decide to tackle with UNIQ. These are <em>career</em> (a change in your job
situation), <em>romance</em> (find a partner, live a fullfilled relationship) and <em>health</em> (feel healthier, achieve a better
fitness level). However, you can also achieve goals in any other area of life, for example <em>personal education</em>,
<em>friendship</em>, <em>hobbies</em> etc.</p>
