<p>Yes, absolutely. The only thing we need is <em>a</em> first name and an email address through which we can contact you. We
donâ€™t care whether these are your real-life contact details. You complete the sessions online, have your 1-on-1
coaching session on the phone and are accompanied to your goal via our chat app. All of this happens whenever and
wherever you want. Our coaches handle all information with absolute confidentiality.</p>
