<p>A self-limiting belief is a mental attitude or conviction, which exists in your brain but you may be unaware of.
It narrows your perception and your willingness to change aspects of your life. Examples of self-limiting beliefs
would be “Being in a relationship means sacrificing all my free time.”, “I can either earn a lot of money or live a
fulfilled life.” etc. Each and everyone of us has self-limiting beliefs and mostly they don’t disturb us. However, when
there is a self-limiting belief between you and your goal, it will be very hard or even impossible for you to achieve
that goal. In this case it’s a good idea to talk to a trained expert to transform the self-limiting belief into a new,
empowering belief. That is exactly what your UNIQ coach helps you achieve during your 1-on-1 session.</p>
