<p>A self-limiting belief is a mental attitude or conviction, that exists in your brain but which you are not aware of.
It narrows your perception and your willingness to change aspects of your life. Examples of self-limiting beliefs
would be “To be in a relationship I must sacrifice my free time”, “I can either earn a lot of money or live a
fulfilled life” etc. Each and everyone of us has self-limiting beliefs and mostly they don’t disturb us. However, when
there is a self-limiting belief between you and your goal, it will be very hard or even impossible for you to achieve
that goal. In these cases it’s a good idea to talk to a trained conversation partner to find out if a self-limiting
belief exists and - if so - turn into a new, inspiring belief. That is exactly what your UNIQ coach does with you
during the 1-on-1 session.</p>
