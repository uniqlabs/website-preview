<p>UNIQ is not for you if you are affected by a psychic disorder. We are <em>no substitute</em> for therapy or professional
counseling. Please contact your local counseling offers or call your country’s emergency number in these cases. We
also won’t be able to help you if have a declared goal, but are not willing to change your life in any way. And
last but not least we won’t support any kind of goal that is unethical or willfully harms other people.</p>
