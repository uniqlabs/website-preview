<p>In our online sessions you can learn various things about yourself, your goals and beliefs, visualize your life and
develop your action plan. We guide with simple questions and additional video and audio content. Sometimes we’ll give
you small “homework” tasks, which you can complete during your daily life to maximize your success in the program.</p>
