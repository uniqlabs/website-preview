<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>Which goals can I achieve with UNIQ?</h4>
    <p>Our method can be used for any kind of goal, as long as it’s measurable and realistic. Realistic means that the goal
must be achievable for you in principle. You can tackle goals both big (e.g. “In 5 years I want to have founded my
own company”) and small (“In 8 weeks I want to have lost 8 pounds.”). If you want to achieve a big goal we help you
derive a meaningful intermediate goal and achieve that.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>What methods is UNIQ based on?</h4>
    <p>UNIQ is based on long-proven methods as well as the latest findings from cognitive and positive psychology. Among
others, we are using the principles of the A-B-C model by Albert Ellis to resolve so-called <em>self-limiting
beliefs</em> during the 1-on-1 coaching session.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>What kind of goals do people typically choose?</h4>
    <p>There are three big goal areas that many people decide to tackle with UNIQ. These are <em>career</em> (a change in your job
situation), <em>relationship</em> (find a partner, start a family) and <em>health</em> (live healthier, achieve a better fitness
level). However, you can also achieve goals in any other area of life, for example <em>personal education</em>,
<em>friendship</em>, <em>hobbies</em> etc.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>Why does the program last 13 weeks?</h4>
    <p>90 days / 13 weeks / a quarter of year - that’s the perfect time period to implement the first steps of sustainable
change in your life. Among other things this has to do with the fact that humans need an average of 66 days to form
a new habit. In contrast to pure “habit formation” apps, UNIQ’s offering is more encompassing, though: Right after
your 1-on-1 coaching session we provide you with a personal chat coach, who will motivate you and help you stay the
course, also and most importantly in phases where it gets difficult.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>What is a "self-limiting belief"?</h4>
    <p>A self-limiting belief is a mental attitude or conviction, that exists in your brain but which you are not aware of.
It narrows your perception and your willingness to change aspects of your life. Examples of self-limiting beliefs
would be “To be in a relationship I must sacrifice my free time”, “I can either earn a lot of money or live a
fulfilled life” etc. Each and everyone of us has self-limiting beliefs and mostly they don’t disturb us. However, when
there is a self-limiting belief between you and your goal, it will be very hard or even impossible for you to achieve
that goal. In these cases it’s a good idea to talk to a trained conversation partner to find out if a self-limiting
belief exists and - if so - turn into a new, inspiring belief. That is exactly what your UNIQ coach does with you
during the 1-on-1 session.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>Are self-limiting beliefs bad?</h4>
    <p>No. They are perfectly normal and every human being has them. They are formed from our experiences and observations
of everyday life and human interaction. Self-limiting beliefs usually don’t disturb us. However, sometimes we may
find ourselves having a hard time to achieve a goal. That’s when it’s a good idea to talk to a trained conversation
partner to find out if a self-limiting belief exists and - if so - turn into a new, inspiring belief. That is
exactly what your UNIQ coach does with you during the 1-on-1 session.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>What if I don't have a self-limiting belief?</h4>
    <p>The 1-on-1 coaching session helps you find a motivating and inspiring belief for your goal. If you have a
self-limiting belief that stands between you and your goal, you will find and resolve it with the help of your coach.
Should you not have a self-limiting belief, that’s all the better! In that case you can use the session to define the
mindset that you find most inspiring and that will motivate you best to work towards your goal.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>What do the online sessions look like?</h4>
    <p>In our online sessions you can learn various things about yourself, your goals and beliefs, visualize your life and
develop your action plan. We guide with simple questions and additional video and audio content. Sometimes we’ll give
you small “homework” tasks, which you can complete during your daily life to maximize your success in the program.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>Do I need to know my goal beforehand?</h4>
    <p>No. With UNIQ you can achieve a goal you have chosen before or find a new goal to achieve. We help you with this. All
that you need is the courage and willingness to change things in your life.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>How can I achieve a "big goal" in 13 weeks?</h4>
    <p>Of course you won’t be running a marathon in 13 weeks if you’re not exercising at all today. But you can work towards
a meaningful intermediate goal that you will achieve within 13 weeks (e.g. go running 3x a week, be signed up for the
10K). The UNIQ program helps you derive and achieve such a meaningful intermediate goal.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>Can I use the program anonymously?</h4>
    <p>Yes, absolutely. The only thing we need is <em>a</em> first name and an email address through which we can contact you. We
don’t care whether these are your real-life contact details. You complete our sessions online, have your 1-on-1
coaching session on the phone and are accompanied to your goal via our chat app. All of this happens whenever and
wherever you want. Our coaches handle all information with absolute confidentiality.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>Do I have to attend a seminar or meet with a coach?</h4>
    <p>No. In contrast to other coaching offers, with us you never need to physically show up anywhere. You complete our
sessions online, have your 1-on-1 coaching session on the phone and are accompanied to your goal via our chat app.
All of this happens whenever and wherever you want. You can also use our program completely anonymously. The only
thing we need is <em>a</em> first name and an email address through which we can contact you.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>How much does UNIQ cost?</h4>
    <p>UNIQ is currently in beta. This means that we are optimizing our training program with early users. In return you can
currently use our entire program <em>free of charge</em>. This includes online modules to identify your life goals, a 1-on-1
coaching session on the phone, the development of your action plan and 12 weeks of chat support from your personal
UNIQ coach. As soon as we introduce paid plans we will announce the pricing on our main page.</p>

    

<div class="faq-entry">
    <h4>When should I not use UNIQ?</h4>
    <p>UNIQ is not for you if you are affected by a psychic disorder. We are <em>no substitute</em> for therapy or professional
counseling. Please contact your local counseling offers or call your country’s emergency number in these cases. We
also won’t be able to help you if have a declared goal, but are not willing to change your life in any way. And
last but not least we won’t support any kind of goal that is unethical or willfully harms other people.</p>
