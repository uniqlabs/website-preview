<p>Our method can be used for any kind of goal, as long as it’s measurable and realistic. By realistic we mean that the
goal is achievable in practice. You can tackle goals both big (e.g. “In 5 years I will have successfully sold my
business.”) and small (“In 8 weeks I will have lost 8 pounds.”). If you want to go for a big goal we help you derive a
meaningful intermediate goal and achieve that in 13 weeks.</p>
