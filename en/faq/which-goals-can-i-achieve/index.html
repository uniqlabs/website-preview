<p>Our method can be used for any kind of goal, as long as it’s measurable and realistic. Realistic means that the goal
must be achievable for you in principle. You can tackle goals both big (e.g. “In 5 years I want to have founded my
own company”) and small (“In 8 weeks I want to have lost 8 pounds.”). If you want to achieve a big goal we help you
derive a meaningful intermediate goal and achieve that.</p>
