<p>Klaas fell in love with software development when he wrote his first lines of BASIC at the age of 7. He holds an
M.Sc. from the University of Michigan, where he developed a deeper interest in algorithms and artificial
intelligence. He then completed a Ph.D. at TU Munich during which, among other things, he taught a robot to find its
way to Munichâ€™s central square and held a lecture on machine learning.</p>

<p>His desire to move closer to the product led him to BMW research, where he was in charge of prototyping innovative
apps and services in the area of door-to-door mobility. In 2015 he left BMW to found his first startup LOCLET, a
location-based trivia game that lets you explore cities playfully.</p>

<p>At UNIQ Klaas is responsible for the digitalization of the coaching experience.</p>
