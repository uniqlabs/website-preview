<p>Klaas fell in love with software development when he wrote his first lines of BASIC at the age of 7. He holds an
M.Sc. from the University of Michigan, where he developed a deeper interest in algorithms and artificial
intelligence. During his Ph.D. at TU Munich he taught a class on machine learning and developed an autonomous robot
that successfully found its way to Munichâ€™s central square in the end.</p>

<p>His passion for product development brought him to BMW research, where he was in charge of prototyping innovative
apps and services in the area of door-to-door mobility. In 2015 he left BMW to found his first startup LOCLET, a
location-based trivia game that lets you explore cities playfully.</p>
